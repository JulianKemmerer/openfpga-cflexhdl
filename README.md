WORK IN PROGRESS

# Building + Testing on Pocket Hardware

TODO check in final .qip/VHDL to reference below...

Given some .qip/VHDL files how to build a pocket image, upload to device, etc
Can include dumb loopback of frame clock needed for quartus work around
Can refence some pocket dev docs

# CflexHDL + PipelineC Flow
Reference old articles and PipelineC-Graphics repo with picture of various flows supported for full Sphery. 

Mention in this version of flow the output is VHDL files and Quartus .qip is used.

TODO update Makefile flow to be easier

# Chasing the Beam Graphics

Explain how the pattern gen works in C code, and how more advanced graphics need more complex rendering pipeline.

Is it possible to also show the donut demo too?


# Sphery vs. Shapes Partial Demo

Show folks what we have working so far with RT_SMALL_UI, explain the issue of device resources, explain some ideas we might have (fast clocks and iterations), call for help etc.
